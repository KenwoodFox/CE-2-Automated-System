My role in the group is simple. I am the main link to VEX systems. I provide the best solutions for our team on VEX parts and building optimization to best help our team.
As far as progress is concerned, we have coded the majority of the code for our system, and most of our system is built, if "finicky."
We are all collaborating, bouncing ideas off of each other, working together to get the project done. Things are going well for the group.
